# MyPython3

The python scripts of this repository based on python 2.7 from MyPython repository.
Now update to python 3.6 and will test if no issues that will start to use python 3.6 to complier.

If no more issues after test on Python 3.6 that will retire Mypython repository and will rename this repository (All Pass!)

# Important Notes:
1. These scripts which based on python 2 then update to 3 had tested and passed during Jan. 8 to 12 on 2018. 
2. Development environment migrate from python 2.7 to 3.6 or more after Jan. 12, 2018  
3. The legacy repository named MyPython will rename to LegacyPython2 as it won't be used and just as a backup repository.
4. Repository named MyPython3 will rename to MyPython and it will become a main Python repository. I'll start to develop on current repository based on Python 3.6 or more.
